    <h1> The Mitchels vs The Machines </h1>
    <h3>Overlaps with other films</h3>
    <subtitle>Overlaps with 2001: A Space Odyssey</subtitle>
    <ul>
        <li>
            AI is an antagonistic force in both films. In 2001, it is significantly more subtle, with HAL being suspected of malfunctioning, then slowly killing the crew, turning off life support systems for the unconscious members and removing the atmosphere of the ship and killing Frank.
            <br>In The Mitchels vs The Machines, AI is always a conspicuous threat, capturing all humans in sight and planning to send them all out to space, killing them.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <subtitle>Overlaps with Robot Dreams</subtitle>
    <ul>
        <li>In both films, plenty of focus is placed on connections between sentient entities.
        <br>In The Mitchels vs The Machines, Katie's family is consistently divided by conflicting interests, such as her father's interest in the wild and Katie's focus on filmmaking.
        <br>In Robot Dreams, Dog's relationship with Robot is a focus, as he is constantly trying to find Robot and struggling to find relationships with other personalities. His relationship with Robot was perfect and he continuously tries to recreate it, whether by trespassing into the beach to find Robot, or attempting to connect with other animals and eventually, Tim.</li>
