<h1>2001: A Space Odyssey</h1>

<h3>Overlaps with other films</h3>
    <subtitle>Overlaps with Robot Dreams</subtitle>
    <ul>
        <li>Both films are praised for their realism. 2001 is praised for their depiction of the future and depth in special effects, but Robot dreams is praised for emotional depth and relatability.</li>
        <li>In both films, you have to infer many aspects, due to the very sparce dialogue. You must try much harder when reading 2001: A Space Odyssey, despite it containing more dialogue, because of it's external story.</li>
        <li>These two films contain much more story outside of the focus of technology compared to the third film. Dave Bowman from 2001 outgrows technology with spiritual evolution, and the monoliths surrounding the universe are being sought after by america's government. 
        <br>Robot dreams has plenty of focus with Dog's external interactions with other personalities, and his life without Robot.</li>
        <li>Recurring musical themes are present in both films. 2001 features recurrent songs that play during the most important scenes.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <subtitle>Overlaps with The Mitchels vs The Machines</subtitle>
    <ul>
        <li>AI is an antagonistic force in both films. In 2001, it is significantly more subtle, with HAL being suspected of malfunctioning, then slowly killing the crew, turning off life support systems for the unconscious members and removing the atmosphere of the ship and killing Frank.
            <br>In The Mitchels vs The Machines, AI is always a conspicuous threat, capturing all humans in sight and planning to send them all out to space, killing them.</li>
        <li>Special effects are a focus in both films. In 2001, this is used to enhance immersion and present Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future.
        <br>In The Mitchels vs The Machines, special effects are mostly brought up and are aware by Katie, who is implied to have added these effects themselves for comedy.</li>
    </ul>
    <subtitle>Depiction of relationship between humans and AI</subtitle>
    <ul>
        <li>
                In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the sole representative of AI is HAL 9000, who is a tragic tale of a self-preserving machine with conflicting programming, who killed the crew due to this.
        </li>
        <li>
            HAL is depicted as a talking, thinking machine with similarities to modern applications such as Zoom and Stockfish, used for faraway contact and recreation respectively.

            <p>In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the sole representative of AI is HAL 9000, who is first introduced as a machine with traits and purposes similar to technologies such as Zoom and Stockfish used for convienience and recreation.
                <br>These present him as a friendly figure, allowing the crew to communicate with far-off family and recreationally playing chess with them, keeping them company on the ship.
                <br>In a way, HAL was intended as no more than the weapons the monkeys used at the start of the film; a tool. This is the movie's preliminary depiction of the relationship of humans and machines.

            <p>In 2001, we have seen HAL display mild emotional depth, whether as a small diversion to save his own skin(doubt he has any) or to gain the trust of the crew.
                <br>This presents a possibility of a future of a relationship of humans and AI from AI being able to connect with human beings, and a create a personality of their own, but only for highly pratical reasons.

            <p>In 2001 yet again, it is shown HAL prioritizes self-preservation, to the point of killing the crew and jeopardizing the mission. 
                <br>This presents a possibility of, when we are too dependant on AI, or technology as a whole, it could outgrow us and start to 'throw us away'.

    In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the sole representative of ai is HAL 9000, who is a tragic tale of a perfect machine who had implemented flaws of a human intended for social connection,
     but used to manipulate and murder the crew. HAL is introduced as a friendly figure, letting the crew communicate to family from their far-off post and 
     recreationally playing chess with them, not so different from communication and recreation technologies we use today. It is noted by chess professionals and chess AI developers that the occuring chess game features minor, human-like imperfections
     that may have forshadowed his later malfunction. HAL's primary programming, which is to accurately relay information is unable to be overridden completely by the mission objective given to him, which was to 
     not disclose the true nature of the film to dave and frank. when the two notice Hal keeping something and acting irrationally, they talk about disconnecting him, and after hal finds out, he 
     decides the best way to balance between telling the truth always and keeping secrets from the conscious onboarders is to kill everyone on the ship, so it does not need to hide
     any information whatsoever, and this hasty decision is further rushed by the threat of disconnection, leaving a very dangerous .
     What is really unfortunate is that none of this had to happen, had the government simply disclosed the classified monolith to Dave and Frank, HAL's dilemma would not have existed, and the mission would be smooth sailing, with a possibility of no crew deaths.
     An interesting deviation presents itself in the novel counterpart to the story, where HAL is remorseful, and this time the orders to disconnect him come from the mission control themselves before Bowman succeeds in doing so and remains the sole survivor. (this sentence adds nothing i might remove it)
     
     This film presents a possibility of an artificial inteligence with extreme cognitive ability, yet humanity and other strict rules causes it to go from a tool to a threat. 
     Is this a good depiction of the relationship between humans and machines? Machines nowadays have had plenty of time to develop, but its premature popularity may prove history to repeat, as the machines are not ready to carry out complicated tasks, and the mitchels will not be well suited to correctly deal with this problem, as we have not the time we need for ai to be fully understood.
