    <!-- ngl i feel like this movie strays from the sci fi aspect and more into the aspect of dealing with loss, 
     interpersonal relationships, and whatnot, not the author's concerns or critisisms of artificial intelligence.
     ai is nothing more but a mediums to express said dealing with loss, interpersoyadayada.

     the film is not a depiction of the relationship between humans and machines, but it doesnt aim to be one, that is not the point of the film.
     but uhh some people grow attached to machines they use, so this can be one interpretation of the film's representation of the relationship between humans and machines.
