<!-- ok whats gonna happen is i have 3 pages with each and at the bottom of each it shows the
 arguements for each movie being a greater depiction of humans and machines, at the 
 bottom of each page lies a button to choose which one you think is best and when that is done 
 your choice is locked in and my personal opinion is revealed -->
<!-- php/wamp/sql is not gonna be nessasary-->
 <!-- Expectations:
 A website (such as a Google Site) in which you discuss the three films in relation to one another, and then articulate which film most compellingly depicts the relationship between humans and machines;
Regardless of which form you choose, you should:

1. Address all three films critically, thoughtfully, and in detail; referring to specific moments, scenes, shots, and other elements of their composition (such as visual design, sound design, story, performance, dialogue, animation, etc...)
2. Be able to support any claims you make about the films with evidence and reference to the films themselves;
3. Use enough description and explanation of your thinking to thoughtfully address the question;
4. Have a clear, direct, and reasonable answer to the question;
5. Effectively communicate your ideas using the form you have chosen, such as through applying appropriate elements of design for a website, effective use of essay style and structure for the review essay, a well organized and coherently constructed presentation, use of clear narrative voice and effective slide design for the slide show (and so on); 
6. Make appropriate choices for your experience, abilities, preferences and comfort! If you don't like doing presentations, don't choose a presentation! If you don't enjoy writing, don't choose the review essay!  -->

    <h1>Take your pick</h1>
    <p>There are 3 pages below depicting my thoughts on each film and their accuracy in their depiction of relationship of humans and machines, then their connections with different films.</p>
    <p>After reading them all, you can take your pick at which film you believe to be the strongest in these regards, before I share my opinion on this.</p>
